Molecular Property Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict a specific molecular property, such as solubility or toxicity, given a dataset of molecules with known property values.
Project Structure

    data/: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
        raw/: Stores the original molecule dataset file.
        processed/: Stores the preprocessed train and test datasets.
    notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.
    src/: Contains the source code for data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
    models/: Stores the trained machine learning model.
    results/: Stores the performance metrics and evaluation results.
    requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages and their versions.

Getting Started

    Install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Place your raw molecule dataset file in the data/raw/ directory.
    Run the following scripts in order:
        src/data_preprocessing.py: Preprocess the raw dataset and split it into train and test sets.
        src/feature_selection.py: Perform feature selection on the preprocessed data.
        src/model_training.py: Train the machine learning model using the selected features.
        src/evaluation.py: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test set.
    The trained model will be saved in the models/ directory, and the performance metrics will be saved in the results/ directory.

Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    RDKit
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn
    Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploratory data analysis)

Extensions

    Explore different feature selection techniques or compare multiple machine learning algorithms.
    Experiment with different hyperparameter settings to optimize the model's performance.
    Visualize the important features and their contributions to the predicted property.
